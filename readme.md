A simple project to find words for solving wordscapes puzzles - a popular mobile game

Note: If using the flask server, you only need to enter the word with gaps if answering 'y' to the previous input

main.py runs a local flask server so that input can be done in a nicer interface within the browser.

terminal usage.py is used for interaction within the terminal
